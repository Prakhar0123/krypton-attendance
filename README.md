Hi, my name is Prakhar Kushwaha and this project is based on Employee Attendance Management. This project has tried to fulfill the basic need for recording attendance & includes the implementation of HTML,CSS,JS,PHP & MySQL.
The index.php file includes the admin login form that will redirect to the attendance dashboard.
The user.php file contains the user/employee login form where the employee will be simply redirected to attendance report page.
